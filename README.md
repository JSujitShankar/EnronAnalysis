# EnronAnalysis
This is a compilation of data visualization and machine learning algorithms applied on the FERC Enron Dataset.
The R programming section deals with data cleaning and visualization techniques I've learned from RPubs and Analytics Edge; credit to them. Comments in the files will help you discern the uses of various commands and functions. 

Using python, machine learning algorithms were applied to test a predictor model in identifying a Person of Interest. It currently works only on identfying if the emails were authored by Chris or Sara. Further work is required for a full fledged predictor model.
